Welcome to my homepage!

I am a final-year Ph.D. candidate at the School of Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE) at Cornell University. I am very fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Jim Dai](https://people.orie.cornell.edu/jdai/) and [Prof. Yudong Chen](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yudongchen/). Prior to joining Cornell, I received my A.B. degree in Statistics from Washington University in St. Louis.

My research interests lie in the fields of applied probability, queueing theory, and reinforcement learning.
